# Cycle-Bike-Analysis
This analysis is done using R programme language.
### Introduction to Problem: 
A bike-share company in Chicago features more
than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclist sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes,
making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders
who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt
for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options.
Users are this program are categorized into two ways: Members, who owns
the annual membership and the casual riders, who don't own the membership
but pays hourly based on the time they use the bike.\

The director of marketing team at cyclist, believes the company’s
future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
Therefore, I want to understand how casual riders and annual members use
Cyclist bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a
new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.\

### Approach 
To get the results, I followed all the phases of data
analysis which are ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYSE, SHARE, ACT.\

### ASK 
To find out how annual members and casual riders use Cyclist
bikes differently. This insights would help the team to design a
marketing strategy targeted at converting casual riders to members to
promote the growth of Cyclist.

### PREPARE 
The data has been made available by Motivate International
Inc. under [this license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
I will be using the trip data from January 2021 to December 2021.
### PROCESS
I have used R to analyze the data. I chose R programming
language because of its flexibility in data manipulation and
visualization. Following is the list of codes that I performed for solving this problem.
